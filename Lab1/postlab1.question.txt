Other than being able to include the method bodies in the .h file, what is the difference between a template class and a normal class?

Also, in relation to that, why does it compile more successfully when the method body is in the .h file?

Since all methods of the List class are available to both a pointer and non-pointer list, in what scenario would it be preferable to use a pointer vs a non-pointer?  What exactly is the difference and what are the limitations to the different identifiers?
