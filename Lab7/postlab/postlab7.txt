	I really enjoyed learning IBCM.   I am currently taking 3330: Computer Architecture and I've been feeling lost in that class all semester.  I think if I had started learning assembly with IBCM, it would have made the transition from high level to low level a lot better.  One of the difficulties I faced in the beginning was remembering the hex digit for specific commands, but once you write one .ibcm file, you definitely get the hang of it.  Another interesting aspect of IBCM is the fact that it only uses one register.  This is a little different compared to x86 which uses 8.  Strangely enough, I actually appreciated having only one register.  I tend to get confused with registers in x86 and I liked being able to keep track of everything through one register.  I do wish there was a way to change IBCM code more seamlessly.  Right now, you leave blank lines in case you need to go back and add additional variable/code, but changing instructions/adding or removing instructions is very hard to do and usually requires rewriting a lot of other instructions.  I had to do this a couple times, especially with the inlab code.  As for the simulator, I thought it was easy to use and I liked being able to step through instructions.  I can't think of any modifications I would want to make to the simulator.  After this lab, I feel fairly confident writing IBCM code.
